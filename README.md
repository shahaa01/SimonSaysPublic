# Simon Says Game

## Overview
Simon Says is a classic memory-based game where players must repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors. This implementation of Simon Says is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive and engaging gameplay experience. This game was developed while I was learning JS.

## Features
- Fully responsive and interactive UI
- Dynamic sequence generation for increasing difficulty
- Smooth animations and sound effects
- Score tracking and game restart functionality
- Optimized only for desktop.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the game
- **CSS**: Styling and animations
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, event handling, and user interaction

## How to Play
1. The game starts with a single color flashing.
2. The player must click the same color to proceed.
3. Each correct selection adds a new color to the sequence.
4. The player must remember and replicate the exact order from previous levels.
5. The game continues until the player makes an incorrect selection.
